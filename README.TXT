Hi, my name is Daniel and this is my first project. I've been studying HTML and CSS for about a month and now I'm starting with Bootstrap and JS. 
I tried to make this as much responsible and user friendly as possible. I created the design myself and tried to recreate it as best as I could with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
Hope to make good progress, feel free to give me any tips or suggestions.
